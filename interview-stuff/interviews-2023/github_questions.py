git merge and git rebase are two different Git commands used for integrating changes from one branch into another. They have different approaches to combining changes and offer distinct advantages and use cases. Here's a brief overview of the differences:

    git merge:
        Purpose: The primary purpose of git merge is to integrate changes from one branch into another.
        Process: When you run git merge, Git creates a new commit that has two parent commitsâ€”the latest commit on the current branch and the latest commit on the branch being merged.
        Commit History: The commit history remains linear, and the branch being merged in retains its commit history.
        Advantages:
            Simple and straightforward.
            Preserves the commit history of both branches.

    bash

# Example of merging 'feature-branch' into 'main'
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

git rebase:

    Purpose: The primary purpose of git rebase is to combine a sequence of commits into a new base commit.
    Process: When you run git rebase, Git identifies the common ancestor commit of the current branch and the branch you are rebasing onto. 
    It then replays the changes from the current branch on top of the other branch, creating a new, linear commit history.
    Commit History: The commit history becomes linear, and it appears as if the changes were made directly on top of the other branch.
    Advantages:
        Creates a cleaner, linear history.
        Reduces the number of merge commits.

bash

    # Example of rebasing 'feature-branch' onto 'main'
    git checkout feature-branch
    git rebase main

When to Use Each:

    Use git merge when you want to preserve the original commit history, and a merge commit accurately represents the integration of changes from one branch to another.
    Use git rebase when you want to maintain a cleaner, more linear commit history. This is often preferred for feature branches that are still in progress before being merged into the main branch.

Important Note:

    Never rebase commits that you have already pushed to a shared repository. Rewriting history with git rebase can cause conflicts for collaborators who have pulled the old history, leading to potential issues.

In summary, the choice between git merge and git rebase depends on your preference for commit history aesthetics and the specific requirements of your project.
