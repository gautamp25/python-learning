What is Docker?
-It is way to package software so it can run on any hardware.
3 thing to know how process works
1. Dockerfile- Dockerfile is blueprint for building a docker image
2. Image- a template for running docker container
3. Container- A container is just a running process like any application.

Image file can be used to spawn the same process multiple times in multiple places.
Tools like kubernetes and swarn come into play to scale containers to an infinite workload.

Commands
1. docker ps- list of all running containers
2. docker build -t fireship/demoapp:1.0 - give your image a name
3. docker run -p 5000:8080 containerid
4. docker volume create shared-stuff
5. docker-compose up- run all the containers together
6. docker-compose down- shut down all the containers

1. Dockerfile- which contains code to build docker image and ultimately run your app as a container.
FROM node:12
WORKDIR /app # add source to the image
COPY package*.json ./ #  it take two args 1. local package json location 2.the place we want to copy it in the container.
RUN npm install # is just like opening a terminal and running command
ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE 8080
CMD["npm","start"] # tells the container how to run the actual application.


VOLUMES- is just a dedicated folder on the host machine and inside this folder a conatiner can create that can be remounted
into future containers or multiple containers at the same time


DEBUGGING-

docker-compose-tool for running multiple docker containers at the same time
docker-compose.yml file

version: '3'
services:
    web: # to define our app
        build: . # to point it to the current working directory where it can find docker file
        ports:
    db: #separate container
        image:"mysql"
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
        volumes:
            - db-data:/foo

volumes:
    db-data:
