Linked List & List Difference:
    1. Linked list does not have indexes
    2. List is contiguous place in memory. 
        3. These are all right next to each other in memory with a LL.

    - All of the nodes are going to be spread all over the place.

    Linked List e.g 11 3 23 7
    Head-Variable head points to the first node in the list here head->11

    Tail-variable tail points to the last node in the list, here tail->7

    each nod points to the next to the next and last points to the None
    11->3->23->7
