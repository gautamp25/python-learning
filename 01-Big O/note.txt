Big O- is way of comparing two sets of code mathematically about how efficient they run in.
Time complexity- is not measured in time, it is measured in the number of operations that it take to complete something.

Space complexity-it is related to memory space.

Best case- Omega
Average case- Theta
Wost case- Omicron

O(n^2)= Loop within a Loop
O(n)= Proportional
O(log n) = Divide and Conquer
O(1) = Constant
